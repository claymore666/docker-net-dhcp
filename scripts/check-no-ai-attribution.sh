# AI-attribution gate: this fork is published as the maintainer's own
# work, so no commit or PR may credit an AI assistant. The rule has
# been in CLAUDE.md from the start and still reached a public branch
# twice, which is why it is enforced mechanically here instead of
# remembered.
#
# Usage: check-no-ai-attribution.sh <commit-range> [pr-body-file]
#   <commit-range>: any git range, e.g. origin/dev..HEAD
#   [pr-body-file]: optional file holding the PR description
#
# Exit: 0 clean, 1 attribution found, 2 cannot check (bad usage/range).
#
# Four surfaces get checked, because all four have been hit:
#   1. message trailers crediting an assistant as co-author
#   2. assistant session-link trailers and footers
#   3. "generated with/by <assistant>" marketing lines
#   4. the commit author/committer IDENTITY itself — cherry-pick and
#      rebase PRESERVE authorship, so a rewrite that strips trailers
#      silently keeps a bad author. This is the one that got missed.
#
# Identity is matched by pattern, NOT against an allowlist of the
# maintainer: external contributors and dependabot author commits here
# too, and they are legitimate.
