# Regression test for the actionlint gate (#127): assert actionlint
# still flags the known-bad fixture, in particular the v0.8.0 trap
# (secrets context in a step-level `if:`), which GitHub rejects at
# parse time and thereby silently disables every trigger of the
# workflow. If this script fails, the linter has lost the teeth we
# rely on — treat it like a failing unit test, not a flaky check.
#
# Usage: test-actionlint.sh [path-to-actionlint]
#
# Exit: 0 linter has its teeth, 1 it lost them, 2 cannot test.
#
# The 2 matters. This test asserts a *non-zero* exit from actionlint, so
# a missing binary exits 127 and sails through that assertion — the run
# then died on the grep and blamed the linter for a regression, when the
# tool was simply absent. Same vacuous-gate shape as #333. The binary is
# now checked up front, and "cannot test" is its own exit code so it can
# never be read as either outcome. CI installs actionlint before calling
# this, so a 2 there means the install step broke and the job should go
# red — which it does, since any non-zero fails the step.
